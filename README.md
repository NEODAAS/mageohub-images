# MAGEO JupyterHub Images
This repository contains the images used in the MAGEO JupyterHub (MAGEOHub) website.
An initContainer clones this repository and mounts it as a volume to a pod
in the cluster, so the template html files can refer to the images locally.

Please visit the [documentation](https://gitlab.ocf.co.uk/pml/mageo/-/wikis/home#MAGEOHub-information)
for more information.

*This repository has been integrated into [JupyterHub Templates](https://gitlab.ocf.co.uk/pml/mageohub-templates).
 None of the content here is pulled onto the cluster or displayed online.*
